## Hi, I'm H. 

- :musical_note: I am studying an undergraduate degree in music at the *Universidad Distrital Francisco JosÃ© de Caldas*.

My experience has been focused on the planning and implementation of web development projects, under the principles of agile development mythologies such as Scrum and version control systems such as GIT. I have assumed roles in both Backend and Frontend using frameworks such as Django, Vue, Angular and micro Frameworks such as Flask. In addition to this, I have experience in handling SQL and NoSQL databases.I consider myself an analytical person, who has skills in handling requirements and understanding problems, I am creative and I coordinate well with others. In addition to this, I like to participate in the planning and leadership of projects, always looking for new challenges that allow me to grow professionally and personally.
